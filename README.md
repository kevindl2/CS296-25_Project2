## Project Description

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Using the 2018 Graybook, I found the total number of professors in each department in the College of Engineering and the average salary of the professors of each department.

Using the TRE dataset, I found the number of instructors ranked excellent or outstanding in each department.

I then divided the number of professors ranked excellent or outstanding by the total number of professors in each department.

I then ranked the departments by the average salary of its professors.

### Final Results
For each department in the College of Engineering, ranked by average professor salary, I plotted the percentage of professors ranked excellent or outstanding.
